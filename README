about:synckey
=============

A small restartless add-on for Firefox to view your Sync Key at
about:synckey. Useful when you only have your mobile device running
Firefox Mobile at hand and you would like to connect to your Sync
account.

1. Install this add-on. It's restartless, so no restart required.
2. Open a new tab and go to about:synckey. Enter the Sync Key into
   your other device.
3. When you're done, you probably want to uninstall the add-on again
   to prevent easy access to your Sync Key.
